### Technologies Used
 - React for building the UI components.

 - Tailwind CSS for styling the application.

 - React Icons for icons.

 - Custom Font (Poppins) for modern typography.

 - API Calls to interact with a mock or real backend service for fetching and modifying book data.

### Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally.

1 . Clone the repository:
          git clone https://github.com/Supipi622/book-library-app.git
          
2 . Go into the project folder:
          cd your-project-folder
          
3. Install dependencies:
          npm install
          
4. Start the React app:
          npm start
          
This will run the app on http://localhost:3000/.

## Optional: Backend Setup (Using JSON Server)
   If you want to save the book data persistently (like a real backend),
you can run a local JSON server.

Install JSON Server globally (only if not installed):
       npm install -g json-server
       Start the server:
       npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3005
      
This will run the fake backend at http://localhost:3005/books.

*** Important ***
Make sure your api.js is pointing to http://localhost:3005.
